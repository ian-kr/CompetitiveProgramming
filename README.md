## Languages Used

- **C++** - Primary language for most solutions
- **Python** - Alternative implementations
- **Java** - Some problem solutions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the platform/problem category of interest
3. Each solution file contains the problem implementation
4. Solutions are typically self-contained and can be compiled/run independently

## Problem Categories

- **Data Structures** - Arrays, trees, graphs, heaps
- **Algorithms** - Sorting, searching, dynamic programming
- **Graph Theory** - DFS, BFS, shortest paths, MST
- **Mathematics** - Number theory, combinatorics, geometry
- **String Processing** - Pattern matching, string algorithms

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest improvements or alternative solutions. Each solution aims to be:
- Correct and efficient
- Well-commented where necessary
- Following competitive programming best practices
